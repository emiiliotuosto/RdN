\begin{abstract}
  Klaim is one of the many contributions of Rocco.
  %
  It mixes together many flavours and borders many research areas.
  %
  One can appreciate Klaim as a basic calculus alternative to other
  name passing calculi such as the pi, join, or ambient.
  %
  Or one can see Klaim as a coordination model bringing the generative
  mechanisms of Linda in the distributed setting.
  %
  Or else one can envisage Klaim as a programming paradigm.

  We propose Klaim as a suitable base for a novel choreographic
  framework.
  %
  More precisely we advocate Klaim as a suitable language onto which
  to project \emph{data-driven} global specifications based on
  distributed tuple spaces.
  %
  These specifications, akin behavioural types, describe the coordination
  from a global point of view.
  %
  Differently from behavioural types though, our specifications
  express the data flow across distributed tuple spaces rather than
  detailing the communication pattern of processes.
  %
  We devise a typeing system to validate Klaim programs against projections
  of our global specifications.
  %
  An interesting feature of our typeing approach is that well-typed
  systems have arbitrary number of participants.
  %
  In standard approaches based on behavioural types, this is often
  achieved at the cost of tremendous technical complications.
